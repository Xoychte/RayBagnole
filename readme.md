# RayBagnole

A C written raylib game made as a personal project for Summer of Making 2025

The goal is to make an enjoyable "easy to learn, hard to master" 2D top-down racing game in which the players get to modify and personalize their car (shape, engine, tyres, turbo/supercharger and so on) with an easy shape-placing system.

(final game name is to be determined)

S - brake (no reverse gear currently) \
