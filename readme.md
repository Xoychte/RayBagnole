# RayBagnole

A C written raylib game made as a personal project for Summer of Making 2025

The goal is to make a enjoyable "easy to learn, hard to master" 2D top-down racing game in which the players gets to modify and personalize their car (shape, engine, tyres, turbo/supercharger and so on) with an easy shape-placing system.

(final game name is to be determined)

## Playing 

Arrows: \
Up - accelerate \
Down - brake (no reverse gear currently) \
Left/Right - steer 

Enter - flip the car (rotate 180Â° instantly)
